# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective  
Understand the components of a strong password by creating and testing different passwords using a password strength evaluation tool.

## Tools Used  
- PasswordMonster.com – Free online password strength checker  
- Custom Passwords – Created with varying length and complexity

## Steps Performed

1. Created multiple passwords with varying levels of complexity:
   - apple123
   - Apple123
   - Apple@123
   - ApP!e_1234$
   - ^@L9f*PzQ8!b$2&

2. Tested each password on passwordmonster.com.
3. Noted the score, estimated time to crack, and strength feedback for each.
4. Identified which patterns increased or decreased password strength.
5. Researched common password attacks such as:
   - Brute Force – Trying every combination
   - Dictionary Attack – Using common words
   - Credential Stuffing – Using leaked passwords
6. Wrote down password creation best practices.

## Key Observations

- Short passwords using only lowercase (Apple123) were rated weak.
- Adding uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols significantly increased strength.
- Passwords longer than 12 characters with symbols were marked as very strong.
- Randomized, complex passwords had estimates like "would take millions of years to crack".

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use 12+ characters.
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
- Avoid using dictionary words, names, or patterns.
- Never reuse passwords** across platforms.
- Use a password manager** to generate and store complex passwords.

## Outcome  
Learned how password complexity impacts security and how attackers exploit weak passwords. Understood how to create strong, unique passwords to reduce risk from brute-force and dictionary-based attacks.
